An AI-powered system for automatic speaker identification and video clip extraction using multimodal analysis combining face recognition, lip-sync detection, and audio diarization.

## Features

* Face Recognition: Identify target speakers across video frames using InsightFace
* Lip-Sync Analysis: SyncNet-based audio-visual synchronization detection
* Speaker Diarization: Automatic "who spoke when" identification via PyAnnotate
* Composite Scoring: Intelligent confidence analysis combining multiple metrics
* Smart Extraction: Generate speaker-specific video clips with temporal grouping
* Visualization: Real-time confidence graphs and analytics
* Web Interface: Easy-to-use Gradio-based UI
* Interactive Chatbot: Ask natural language questions about extracted clips using a chat-based interface

## Use Cases

* Media Production: Streamline video editing by automatically extracting speaker segments
* Meeting Analysis: Analyze video conferences and extract key speaking moments
* Content Creation: Generate speaker-specific highlights from interviews or panels
* Security Applications: Identify persons of interest in surveillance footage
* Educational Content: Segment lectures or presentations by specific speakers
* Podcast Production: Automatically separate multi-speaker content
* Interactive Review: Query transcripts using the built-in chatbot for faster insights

## Technical Architecture

The pipeline combines multiple AI technologies:

1. Face Detection & Recognition (InsightFace + MediaPipe)
2. Audio Processing (Librosa + PyAnnotate)
3. Lip-Sync Detection (Custom SyncNet implementation)
4. Temporal Analysis (Composite scoring with Gaussian smoothing)
5. Video Processing (MoviePy + FFmpeg)

## Requirements

### System Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* CUDA-compatible GPU (optional, for faster processing)
* FFmpeg installed on system

### API Keys Required

* Hugging Face account and token
* PyAnnotate API key for speaker diarization

### Hardware Recommendations

* CPU: Multi-core processor (8+ cores recommended)
* RAM: 16GB+ for processing large videos
* GPU: CUDA-compatible GPU for faster inference (optional)
* Storage: SSD recommended for temporary file processing

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/video-speaker-analysis-pipeline.git
cd video-speaker-analysis-pipeline
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Install System Dependencies

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg

# macOS
brew install ffmpeg

# Windows
# Download FFmpeg from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
```

### 5. Setup API Keys

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN=your_hf_token_here
PYANNOTE_TOKEN=your_pyannote_token_here
HF_REPO_ID=your_username/your_repo_name
```

## Usage

### Web Interface (Standard UI)

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open [http://localhost:7860](http://localhost:7860) in your browser.

### Chatbot Interface

The pipeline includes a chat-based interface that allows users to ask natural language questions about the content of speaker clips. For example:

* "Where is the speaker talking about deadlines?"
* "Summarize what was said in this clip."
* "What was the opinion expressed?"

To launch the chatbot:

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open [http://localhost:7860](http://localhost:7860) and use the interactive chat interface.

This interface processes clips located in the output directory and analyzes them via transcript-to-LLM pipelines.

### Command Line Usage

```python
from video_processor import VideoProcessor
from audio_processor import AudioProcessor

video_proc = VideoProcessor()
audio_proc = AudioProcessor()

results = run_pipeline(
    video_path="path/to/video.mp4",
    reference_image="path/to/reference.jpg",
    hf_token="your_token",
    pyannotate_token="your_token",
    repo_id="username/repo"
)
```

### Input Requirements

* Video: MP4, AVI, MOV formats supported
* Reference Image: Clear photo of target speaker (JPG, PNG)
* Video Quality: 720p+ recommended for better face detection

## How It Works

### 1. Face Matching

* Extracts keyframes from input video
* Uses InsightFace to generate face embeddings
* Matches against reference image using cosine similarity
* Filters frames with confidence threshold (default: 0.6)

### 2. Audio Processing

* Extracts audio track from video
* Uploads to Hugging Face for PyAnnotate processing
* Performs speaker diarization to identify speech segments
* Returns timestamped speaker information

### 3. Lip Motion Analysis

* Analyzes facial landmarks using MediaPipe
* Calculates lip movement metrics (height + width)
* Measures temporal changes in lip geometry
* Combines with audio features for robust detection

### 4. Sync Confidence

* Implements SyncNet architecture for audio-visual sync
* Processes 0.5-second audio clips around each frame
* Calculates cosine similarity between audio and visual features
* Normalizes confidence scores to 0–1 range

### 5. Composite Scoring

```python
composite_score = 0.7 * lip_motion_score + 0.3 * sync_confidence
```

### 6. Clip Extraction

* Groups continuous speaking segments
* Merges segments with gaps < 1 second
* Exports final clips with metadata

## Output Files

* Video Clips: `clip_1_start-end.mp4`, `clip_2_start-end.mp4`, etc.
* Analysis Data: `lip_motion_scores.csv` with frame-by-frame confidence
* Speaker Mapping: `matched_with_speakers.csv` with speaker assignments
* Visualizations: `speech_confidence.png` with confidence graphs
* Diarization: `diarization_output.csv` with speaker timestamps

## Configuration

### Adjustable Parameters

```python
FACE_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.6
LIP_MOTION_WEIGHT = 0.7
SYNC_CONFIDENCE_WEIGHT = 0.3
SEGMENT_MERGE_THRESHOLD = 1.0
GAUSSIAN_SIGMA = 3
```

### Performance Tuning

```python
# For faster processing
VIDEO_RESOLUTION = (640, 480)
KEYFRAME_INTERVAL = 2  # seconds

# For better accuracy
VIDEO_RESOLUTION = (1280, 720)
KEYFRAME_INTERVAL = 0.5  # seconds
```

## Testing

### Run the test suite

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

### Test with sample data

```bash
python test_pipeline.py --video sample_video.mp4 --reference sample_face.jpg
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. No faces detected**

* Use a clear, front-facing reference image
* Improve lighting conditions
* Ensure the image format is supported

**2. PyAnnotate API errors**

* Validate API key
* Ensure successful audio upload
* Check for quota limits

**3. CUDA out of memory**

* Reduce batch size or use CPU
* Process shorter video chunks
* Lower resolution

**4. Poor sync detection**

* Ensure audio is not corrupted
* Improve video quality
* Adjust detection thresholds

### Performance Issues

**Slow Processing**

* Enable GPU acceleration
* Reduce input resolution
* Process only selected segments

**High Memory Usage**

* Split video into smaller parts
* Free memory between steps
* Use float16 models if possible
